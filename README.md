##  Event Planning Website

Event-ually Perfect is a full-stack event planning platform that connects event planners and vendors within a unified digital ecosystem. The system streamlines the event management workflow, promotes real-time collaboration, and centralizes communication and data management. Event-ually Perfect provides an end-to-end solution that enables planners to create and manage events, discover and engage vendors, negotiate and manage contracts, invite and track guests, exchange messages in real-time, find inspiration, and export event-related data and artifacts. Vendors, in turn, can maintain detailed profiles, manage requests, and communicate seamlessly with planners.
